    "text": "College football isn’t just a game, it’s a thrilling experience that draws the attention of so many. With these exciting games and atmospheres, the home field advantage becomes more and more of a factor.\nMany teams enjoy a unique advantage when playing on their home field in college football. Let’s look at some numbers to explore why the SEC is named to have the biggest home field advantage compared to other conferences.\nIn fact, does the SEC have the biggest home court advantage?\nWhen looking at some data sets from the college football season of 2022, it becomes clear that the SEC conference stands out in some aspects.\nThe first question is going to be how do college football teams perform in terms of points scored in home and away games, and does this show anything significant? Here is a breakdown off the average points scored by each conference at home and away.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggbump)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(wehoop)\nlibrary(patchwork)\n\nfootball &lt;- read_csv(\"footballlogs22.csv\")\n\nPointsscored &lt;- football |&gt;\n  group_by(Conference) |&gt;\n  summarize(PointsscoredHomeAway = sum(TeamScore + OpponentScore))\n\nhome &lt;- football |&gt;\n  filter(is.na(HomeAway) == \"TRUE\")\n\nOppscoreH &lt;- football |&gt;\n  group_by(Conference) |&gt;\n  filter(is.na(HomeAway) == \"TRUE\") |&gt;\n  summarize(OpponentScoreHome = mean(OpponentScore))\n\nhomepoints &lt;- home |&gt;\n  group_by(Conference) |&gt;\n  summarize(Pointsathome = mean(TeamScore))\n\n\naway &lt;- football |&gt;\n  filter(HomeAway == \"@\")\n\n\nOppscoreA &lt;- football |&gt;\n  group_by(Conference) |&gt;\nfilter(HomeAway == \"@\")\n  \n\nawaypoints &lt;- away |&gt;\n  group_by(Conference) |&gt;\n  summarize(Pointsaway = mean(TeamScore))\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bump(data=Pointsscored, aes(x=PointsscoredHomeAway, y=Conference, color=Conference)) +\n  geom_bump(data=homepoints, aes(x=Pointsathome, y=Conference, color=Conference)) +\n  geom_point(data=homepoints, aes(x=Pointsathome, y=Conference, color=Conference), size = 4) +\n  geom_bump(data=awaypoints, aes(x=Pointsaway, y=Conference, color=Conference)) +\n  geom_point(data=awaypoints, aes(x=Pointsaway, y=Conference, color=Conference), size = 2) +\n  \n  labs(\n  title=\"Average points scored in college football\", \n  subtitle=\"Big cirlce are points scored at home.

It shows that the SEC is one of the highest scoring conferences at home, which shows dominance on their home turf.\nSome other teams might have a bigger point margin or points scored at home but to look for a bigger indicator, let’s have a look at the number of games won at home and away in the SEC.\nIs there a significant difference between the performance of the SEC compared to any other conference when playing at home or away?\n\n\nCode\nTotalgames &lt;- football |&gt;\n  filter(TeamScore &gt; -1) |&gt;\n  group_by(Conference) |&gt;\n  summarize(TotalGames = n())\n  \n\nHome &lt;- football |&gt;\n  filter(is.na(HomeAway) == \"TRUE\")\n\nHomewins &lt;- Home |&gt;\n  group_by(Conference) |&gt;\n  filter(Outcome == \"W\") |&gt;\n   summarize(HomeWins = n()) \n\nbar2 &lt;- ggplot() + geom_bar(data=Homewins, aes(x=reorder(Conference,HomeWins),weight=HomeWins)) +\n  coord_flip()\n\nAway &lt;- football |&gt;\n  group_by(Conference) |&gt;\n  filter(HomeAway == \"@\", Outcome==\"W\") |&gt;\n  summarize(AwayWins = n())\n\n\nbar3 &lt;- ggplot() + geom_bar(data=Away, aes(x=reorder(Conference,AwayWins),weight=AwayWins)) +\n  coord_flip()\n\nSEC &lt;- Homewins |&gt; filter(Conference == \"Southeastern Conference\") \nSEC2 &lt;- Away |&gt; filter(Conference == \"Southeastern Conference\")\nbar2 &lt;- ggplot() + geom_bar(data=Homewins, aes(x=reorder(Conference,HomeWins),weight=HomeWins), fill=\"grey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=SEC, aes(x=reorder(Conference,HomeWins),weight=HomeWins), fill=\"red\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Conference\", \n    y=\"Wins at Home\"\n    ) + \n  theme_minimal() \n\nbar3 &lt;- ggplot() + geom_bar(data=Away, aes(x=reorder(Conference,AwayWins),weight=AwayWins), fill=\"grey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=SEC2, aes(x=reorder(Conference,AwayWins),weight=AwayWins), fill=\"red\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Conference\", \n    y=\"Wins Away\") + \n  theme_minimal() \n\nbar2 + bar3 + \n  plot_annotation(\n    title = \"This shows the amount of college football games won at home and away\",\n    subtitle = \"Games won in each conference depending on the place.\",\n    caption = \"Source: Sports Reference | By Nic Wiedenhorn\"\n  )  & \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nThese bar charts represent the amount of games won at home and games won on the road. The red bar represents the SEC conference and shows how much they stand out at home. This shows the hard challenge for teams in the SEC playing away.\nWhat conclusions can be drawn when looking at the win percentage of the SEC and other conferences at home and away games, and does this support the challenge of playing at the SEC?\n\n\nCode\nhome_data &lt;- football |&gt;\n  filter(is.na(HomeAway) == \"TRUE\") |&gt;\n  group_by(Conference) |&gt;\n  summarize(HomeWins = mean(Outcome == \"W\"))\n\naway_data &lt;- football |&gt;\n  filter(HomeAway == \"@\") |&gt;\n  group_by(Conference) |&gt;\n  summarize(AwayWins = mean(Outcome == \"W\"))\n\nconfwins &lt;- home_data |&gt; inner_join(away_data)\n\nconfwins |&gt;\n  gt() |&gt;\n  cols_label(\n    HomeWins = \"HomeWinPercentage\",\n    \n    AwayWins = \"AwayWinPercentage\",\n    \n  ) |&gt;\n    fmt_percent(\n    columns = c(HomeWins,AwayWins),\n    decimals = 1\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Is the SEC the hardest conference to play away?\",\n    subtitle = \"The SEC has the highest home win percenate out of every conference.\"\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"Source: Sports Reference | By Nic Wiedenhorn\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n     )\n  ) |&gt;\n  opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") |&gt;\n    \n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"red\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Conference == \"Southeastern Conference\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Is the SEC the hardest conference to play away?\n    \n    \n      The SEC has the highest home win percenate out of every conference.\n    \n    \n      Conference\n      HomeWinPercentage\n      AwayWinPercentage\n    \n  \n  \n    American Athletic Conference\n58.6%\n44.1%\n    Atlantic Coast Conference\n61.1%\n48.6%\n    Big 12 Conference\n69.2%\n45.3%\n    Big Ten Conference\n60.8%\n50.7%\n    Conference USA\n63.1%\n32.9%\n    Independent\n63.4%\n34.2%\n    Mid-American Conference\n51.5%\n41.3%\n    Mountain West Conference\n61.8%\n30.4%\n    Pac-12 Conference\n65.8%\n42.9%\n    Southeastern Conference\n73.5%\n46.9%\n    Sun Belt Conference\n66.3%\n37.8%\n  \n  \n    \n      Source: Sports Reference | By Nic Wiedenhorn\n    \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, these graphics show that the SEC has the most games won at home by far with the biggest win percentage at home.

    "text": "Tennis is a sport where the serve is one of the biggest weapons, often even decides about the outcome of matches. In tennis the serve always starts the point and is the only shot in tennis where the opponent has no influence on and therefore very important. This analysis is going to dive into the importance of how placement and speed will influence the chance to hold serve.\nOne of the most important aspects of the serve is the variability. Each ace can be a game changer, but a double fault could also mean trouble. The service quality can depend on many reasons like the height, technique, racket and many more but what’s the most important on the serve?\nThere is a lot of strategy included which sets the tone for the service games. This analysis is going to look into the average serve speed of the first and second serve as well as the placement measured in aces and how that influences the chance to hold serve.\nLet’s take a look at the average serving speed at the ATP Finals. The two highlighted players are arguably the best players in the world right now.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(wehoop)\nlibrary(patchwork)\n\nfirstservespeed &lt;- read_csv(\"1ServeAveragSpeedProject.csv\")\n\nsecondservespeed &lt;- read_csv(\"2ServeAverageSpeedProject.csv\")\n\nfirstservespeed &lt;- firstservespeed |&gt;\n  mutate(value = gsub(\" km/h\", \"\", value, fixed = TRUE), value = as.numeric(value))\n\nsecondservespeed &lt;- secondservespeed |&gt;\n  mutate(value = gsub(\" km/h\", \"\", value, fixed = TRUE), value = as.numeric(value))\n \n\nSinner1 &lt;- firstservespeed |&gt; filter(name == \"Jannik Sinner\") \nDjokovic1 &lt;- firstservespeed |&gt; filter(name == \"Novak Djokovic\")\nSinner2 &lt;- secondservespeed |&gt; filter(name == \"Jannik Sinner\") \nDjokovic2 &lt;- secondservespeed |&gt; filter(name == \"Novak Djokovic\") \nbar1 &lt;- ggplot() +\ngeom_bar(data=firstservespeed, aes(x=reorder(name,value),weight=value),fill=\"grey\") +\ngeom_bar(data=Sinner1, aes(x=reorder(name,value),weight=value),fill=\"blue\") +\ngeom_bar(data=Djokovic1, aes(x=reorder(name,value),weight=value),fill=\"red\") +  \n  coord_flip() + \n  labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Average First Serve Speed\"\n    ) + \n  theme_minimal()\n\nbar2 &lt;- ggplot() +\ngeom_bar(data=secondservespeed, aes(x=reorder(name,value),weight=value),fill=\"grey\") +\ngeom_bar(data=Sinner2, aes(x=reorder(name,value),weight=value),fill=\"blue\") +\ngeom_bar(data=Djokovic2, aes(x=reorder(name,value),weight=value),fill=\"red\") + \ncoord_flip() +  \n  labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Average Second Serve Speed\") + \n  theme_minimal() \n\n\nbar1 + bar2 +\n  plot_annotation(\n    title = \"Average Serving Speed During ATP Finals\",\n    subtitle = \"Average speed for first and second serve in KM/H.\",\n    caption = \"Source: Ultimate Tennis Statistics | By Nic Wiedenhorn\"\n  ) & \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nThis chart shows the comparison of the average serve speed of all players for the first and second serve. That considered, let’s take a look at the two highlighted players. These two performed the best in the tournament and ended up playing in the finals against each other.\nLooking at this statistic, both are in the middle or bottom part of the chart even though they played the finals against each other. Maybe there is another reason why they had better service games.\nDoes this mean the serve speed is necessary for a good service game?\nLet’s take a look at the number of aces and doubles faults from each player.\n\n\nCode\n Aces &lt;- read_csv(\"AcesProject.csv\")\n\n\ndoublefaults &lt;- read_csv(\"DoublefaultsProject.csv\")\n\ndoublef &lt;- doublefaults |&gt;\n  group_by(name) |&gt;\n  filter(value &gt; 0) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    DoubelFaults = sum(value)\n  ) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(DoubelFaults))\n\nAcesDoublefaults &lt;- Aces |&gt; inner_join(doublef)\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=AcesDoublefaults, \n    aes(y=reorder(name, active), x=value, xend=DoubelFaults),\n    size = 2,\n    colour = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"green\",\n    colour_xend = \"red\") +\n  labs(\n    title=\"Aces vs Doublefaults at the ATP Finals\", \n    subtitle = \"If &lt;span style = 'color:green;'&gt;Aces&lt;/span&gt; are on the right, that's good.

When looking at this chart it becomes clear that the precision which can be seen as aces can have a very big impact on the service games.\nThis chart presented the balance between aces and double faults for each player. Without even highlighting the two players from before we can see that they stand out. Djokovic and Sinner have an average amount of double faults but when it comes to aces the are way ahead.\nWhat conclusion can be drawn when looking at the number of aces and double faults in regards of service game holds? Let’s look which players hold their serve more than others in comparison.\n\n\nCode\nwinpercentage &lt;- read_csv(\"ServiceGamesWon%.csv\")\n\nonlygames &lt;- winpercentage |&gt;\n  select(rank,name,value)\n\naces &lt;- read_csv(\"AcesProject.csv\")\n\n \n  \nNewaces &lt;- aces |&gt;\n  group_by(name) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    TotalAces = sum(value)\n  ) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(TotalAces))\n\naceswins &lt;- Newaces |&gt; inner_join(onlygames) |&gt;\n  select(name, TotalAces, value) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(value))\n\naceswins |&gt;\n  gt() |&gt;\n  cols_label(\n    value = \"Service Games Won\"\n    \n  ) |&gt;\n    fmt_percent(\n    columns = c(value),\n    decimals = 1\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Do players with more aces hold serve more often?\",\n    subtitle = \"This table shows the percentage of service games won.\"\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"Source: Sports Reference | By Nic Wiedenhorn\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n     )\n  ) |&gt;\n  opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") |&gt;\n    \n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"blue\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = name == \"Jannik Sinner\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"red\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = name == \"Novak Djokovic\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Do players with more aces hold serve more often?\n    \n    \n      This table shows the percentage of service games won.\n    \n    \n      name\n      TotalAces\n      Service Games Won\n    \n  \n  \n    Jannik Sinner\n53\n92.54%\n    Novak Djokovic\n51\n91.18%\n    Alexander Zverev\n35\n89.19%\n    Carlos Alcaraz Garfia\n29\n86.05%\n    Daniil Medvedev\n27\n86.05%\n    Hubert Hurkacz\n24\n85.71%\n    Stefanos Tsitsipas\n7\n81.82%\n    Holger Vitus Nodskov Rune\n34\n78.79%\n    Andrey Rublev\n12\n68.97%\n  \n  \n    \n      Source: Sports Reference | By Nic Wiedenhorn"
