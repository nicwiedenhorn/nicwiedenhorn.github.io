    "text": "College football isn’t just a game, it’s a thrilling experience that draws the attention of so many. With these exciting games and atmospheres, the home field advantage becomes more and more of a factor.\nMany teams enjoy a unique advantage when playing on their home field in college football. Let’s look at some numbers to explore why the SEC is named to have the biggest home field advantage compared to other conferences.\nIn fact, does the SEC have the biggest home court advantage?\nWhen looking at some data sets from the college football season of 2022, it becomes clear that the SEC conference stands out in some aspects.\nThe first question is going to be how do college football teams perform in terms of points scored in home and away games, and does this show anything significant? Here is a breakdown off the average points scored by each conference at home and away.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggbump)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(wehoop)\nlibrary(patchwork)\n\nfootball &lt;- read_csv(\"footballlogs22.csv\")\n\nPointsscored &lt;- football |&gt;\n  group_by(Conference) |&gt;\n  summarize(PointsscoredHomeAway = sum(TeamScore + OpponentScore))\n\nhome &lt;- football |&gt;\n  filter(is.na(HomeAway) == \"TRUE\")\n\nOppscoreH &lt;- football |&gt;\n  group_by(Conference) |&gt;\n  filter(is.na(HomeAway) == \"TRUE\") |&gt;\n  summarize(OpponentScoreHome = mean(OpponentScore))\n\nhomepoints &lt;- home |&gt;\n  group_by(Conference) |&gt;\n  summarize(Pointsathome = mean(TeamScore))\n\n\naway &lt;- football |&gt;\n  filter(HomeAway == \"@\")\n\n\nOppscoreA &lt;- football |&gt;\n  group_by(Conference) |&gt;\nfilter(HomeAway == \"@\")\n  \n\nawaypoints &lt;- away |&gt;\n  group_by(Conference) |&gt;\n  summarize(Pointsaway = mean(TeamScore))\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bump(data=Pointsscored, aes(x=PointsscoredHomeAway, y=Conference, color=Conference)) +\n  geom_bump(data=homepoints, aes(x=Pointsathome, y=Conference, color=Conference)) +\n  geom_point(data=homepoints, aes(x=Pointsathome, y=Conference, color=Conference), size = 4) +\n  geom_bump(data=awaypoints, aes(x=Pointsaway, y=Conference, color=Conference)) +\n  geom_point(data=awaypoints, aes(x=Pointsaway, y=Conference, color=Conference), size = 2) +\n  \n  labs(\n  title=\"Average points scored in college football\", \n  subtitle=\"Big cirlce are points scored at home. Small circle are points away\",\n  caption = \"Source: Sports Reference | By Nic Wiedenhorn\",\n   y= \"Conference\", \n  x = \"Points scored\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  \n  \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\nThis chart reveals the average points scored at home and the points scored away for each conference. It shows that the SEC is one of the highest scoring conferences at home, which shows dominance on their home turf.\nSome other teams might have a bigger point margin or points scored at home but to look for a bigger indicator, let’s have a look at the number of games won at home and away in the SEC.\nIs there a significant difference between the performance of the SEC compared to any other conference when playing at home or away?\n\n\nCode\nTotalgames &lt;- football |&gt;\n  filter(TeamScore &gt; -1) |&gt;\n  group_by(Conference) |&gt;\n  summarize(TotalGames = n())\n  \n\nHome &lt;- football |&gt;\n  filter(is.na(HomeAway) == \"TRUE\")\n\nHomewins &lt;- Home |&gt;\n  group_by(Conference) |&gt;\n  filter(Outcome == \"W\") |&gt;\n   summarize(HomeWins = n()) \n\nbar2 &lt;- ggplot() + geom_bar(data=Homewins, aes(x=reorder(Conference,HomeWins),weight=HomeWins)) +\n  coord_flip()\n\nAway &lt;- football |&gt;\n  group_by(Conference) |&gt;\n  filter(HomeAway == \"@\", Outcome==\"W\") |&gt;\n  summarize(AwayWins = n())\n\n\nbar3 &lt;- ggplot() + geom_bar(data=Away, aes(x=reorder(Conference,AwayWins),weight=AwayWins)) +\n  coord_flip()\n\nSEC &lt;- Homewins |&gt; filter(Conference == \"Southeastern Conference\") \nSEC2 &lt;- Away |&gt; filter(Conference == \"Southeastern Conference\")\nbar2 &lt;- ggplot() + geom_bar(data=Homewins, aes(x=reorder(Conference,HomeWins),weight=HomeWins), fill=\"grey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=SEC, aes(x=reorder(Conference,HomeWins),weight=HomeWins), fill=\"red\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Conference\", \n    y=\"Wins at Home\"\n    ) + \n  theme_minimal() \n\nbar3 &lt;- ggplot() + geom_bar(data=Away, aes(x=reorder(Conference,AwayWins),weight=AwayWins), fill=\"grey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=SEC2, aes(x=reorder(Conference,AwayWins),weight=AwayWins), fill=\"red\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Conference\", \n    y=\"Wins Away\") + \n  theme_minimal() \n\nbar2 + bar3 + \n  plot_annotation(\n    title = \"This shows the amount of college football games won at home and away\",\n    subtitle = \"Games won in each conference depending on the place.\",\n    caption = \"Source: Sports Reference | By Nic Wiedenhorn\"\n  )  & \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nThese bar charts represent the amount of games won at home and games won on the road. The red bar represents the SEC conference and shows how much they stand out at home. This shows the hard challenge for teams in the SEC playing away.\nWhat conclusions can be drawn when looking at the win percentage of the SEC and other conferences at home and away games, and does this support the challenge of playing at the SEC?\n\n\nCode\nhome_data &lt;- football |&gt;\n  filter(is.na(HomeAway) == \"TRUE\") |&gt;\n  group_by(Conference) |&gt;\n  summarize(HomeWins = mean(Outcome == \"W\"))\n\naway_data &lt;- football |&gt;\n  filter(HomeAway == \"@\") |&gt;\n  group_by(Conference) |&gt;\n  summarize(AwayWins = mean(Outcome == \"W\"))\n\nconfwins &lt;- home_data |&gt; inner_join(away_data)\n\nconfwins |&gt;\n  gt() |&gt;\n  cols_label(\n    HomeWins = \"HomeWinPercentage\",\n    \n    AwayWins = \"AwayWinPercentage\",\n    \n  ) |&gt;\n    fmt_percent(\n    columns = c(HomeWins,AwayWins),\n    decimals = 1\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Is the SEC the hardest conference to play away?\",\n    subtitle = \"The SEC has the highest home win percenate out of every conference.\"\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"Source: Sports Reference | By Nic Wiedenhorn\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n     )\n  ) |&gt;\n  opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") |&gt;\n    \n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"red\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Conference == \"Southeastern Conference\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Is the SEC the hardest conference to play away?\n    \n    \n      The SEC has the highest home win percenate out of every conference.\n    \n    \n      Conference\n      HomeWinPercentage\n      AwayWinPercentage\n    \n  \n  \n    American Athletic Conference\n58.6%\n44.1%\n    Atlantic Coast Conference\n61.1%\n48.6%\n    Big 12 Conference\n69.2%\n45.3%\n    Big Ten Conference\n60.8%\n50.7%\n    Conference USA\n63.1%\n32.9%\n    Independent\n63.4%\n34.2%\n    Mid-American Conference\n51.5%\n41.3%\n    Mountain West Conference\n61.8%\n30.4%\n    Pac-12 Conference\n65.8%\n42.9%\n    Southeastern Conference\n73.5%\n46.9%\n    Sun Belt Conference\n66.3%\n37.8%\n  \n  \n    \n      Source: Sports Reference | By Nic Wiedenhorn\n    \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, these graphics show that the SEC has the most games won at home by far with the biggest win percentage at home. That shows that teams in the SEC don’t only face skillful teams but also have to overcome the challenge of playing on the road. The SEC isn’t just a hard football conference, it’s a challenge to overcome for those who want to be National Champions."
